~~~~~~~~~~      Data Structure and Algorithm       ~~~~~~~~~~

What is Data Structure and Algorithm? 
    Data Structure and Algorithm is a concept which contains all the necessary steps and procedures to organize and store data in a proper way.

Why do we need DSA?
    By learning DSA, we will able to solve a problem in a more procedural approach by considering several factors,such that we can able to maintain a efficient program, meanwhile getting effctive results

What are the types of DSA available? 
    When it comes to Data Structures, it has two types namely,
        1. Primitive Data Structure: 
            This type of data strutures includes the basic data types available in all the programming languages. Examples of primitive data structures includes 1. Integer, 2. Float, 3. Character, 4. Boolean, 5. Pointers(_for some languages_)
        
        2. Non-Primitive Data Structures: 
            This type of data structures includes the highly complex data types available in the pogramming languages. This Data structure consists of 2 types namely, 
            
            1. Linear Data Structure: 
                This type of data structure holds the data which is in Linear or Sequential order. Examples of Linear data structures includes 1. Arrays, 2. LinkedList, 3. Stacks, 4. Queues

            2. Non-Linear Data Structure: 
                This type of Data Structures holds the data which are not arranged in sequential order. We use this data struture type to handle data which is in complex relationships. Examples of Non-Linear data structures includes 1. Trees, 2. Graphs, 3. Heaps, 4. Hash Tables, 5. Trie

    When it comes to Algorithm, it has severals kinds namely, 
        1.
